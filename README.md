# Tour-de-France
The Tour de France is an annual menâ€™s multiple stage bicycle race primarily held in France. The race was first organized in 1903 and has been held annually since, except when stopped for the two World Wars. The modern editions of the tour consist of 21 day long stages over a 23 or 24 day period and cover approximately 3500 km total. The rider with the lowest cumulative time is the leader of the race and wears the yellow jersey. 

**Goal:** To increase the race's popularity around the world by creating an infographic style visual to educate new viewers, highlight the magnitude of the event and to build anticipation for current year's race.
